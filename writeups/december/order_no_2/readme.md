#### By looking into the question:
` "".join(list(map(lambda x: chr(x), ord))) ` (a python code) executed in python shell which provided the output ` 'ŐĠĴǠŌĘĐČǬǤÀǔżƜÀÜżǐƠÌżǈÄƜƠǐżÀǈƐÌǈǴ' `

map: takes two iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) that contains the items you want to transform. Here it is used along with lamda (a small function).
join: used here to make a string out of list.
ord() takes a single character and returns its Unicode code point (integer).
chr() takes a Unicode code point (integer) and returns the corresponding character.
